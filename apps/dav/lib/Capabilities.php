	 * - <chunking>: version number of chunking on the client
	 *
	 * - <max_single_upload_request_duration_msec>: Dynamic Chunking attribute the maximum number of miliseconds that single request below chunk size can take
	 * 		This value should be based on heuristics with default value 10000ms, time it takes to transfer 10MB chunk on 1MB/s upload link.
	 *
	 * 		Suggested solution will be to evaluate max(SNR, MORD) where:
	 * 	    > SNR - Slow network request, so time it will take to transmit default chunking sized request on the current client version to sync at specific low upload bandwidth
	 *      > MORD - Maximum observed request time, so double the time of maximum observed RTT of the very small PUT request (e.g. 1kB) to the system
	 *
	 * 		Exemplary, syncing 100MB files, with chunking size 10MB, will cause sync of 10 PUT requests which max evaluation was set to <max_single_upload_request_duration_msec>
	 *
	 * 		Dynamic chunking client algorithm is specified in the ownCloud documentation and uses <max_single_upload_request_duration_msec> to estimate if given
	 * 		bandwidth allows higher chunk sizes (because of high goodput)

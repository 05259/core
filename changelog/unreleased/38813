Bugfix: Report share expiration at end of day

If shares have an expiration date set then they are valid until the end of the
specified date. But shares report the expiration like 2021-06-15 00:00:00.
This has caused some confusion about when the share actually stops working.
The expiration time is now reported as 23:59:59.

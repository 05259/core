Enhancement: Prevent migration between normal and guest users in UI

OC 10 does not support the migration from normal users to guest users and
vice versa. The fix clarifies this behavior in the Web UI by omitting the
guest-group when adding or editing (non-guest) users and by disabling the
ability to remove guest users from the guest group.
